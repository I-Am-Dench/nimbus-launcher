# LEGO速 Universe Launcher

The LEGO速 Universe Launcher helps players add, swap, and run variable server configurations with just a few clicks of a button.

This program DOES NOT include a LEGO速 Universe client and/or its contents. Players must already have a client located on their system and configure the launcher to point to the client's directory.

Due to the LEGO Group's wishes, LEGO速 Universe servers ARE NOT (and should not) be publicly available. The launcher is NOT a server browser. All server configurations managed by the launcher should be sent to players individually.
